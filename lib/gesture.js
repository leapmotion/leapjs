/**
 * Constructs a new Gesture object.
 *
 * An uninitialized Gesture object is considered invalid. Get valid instances
 * of the Gesture class, which will be one of the Gesture subclasses, from a
 * Frame object.
 *
 * @class Gesture
 * @abstract
 * @memberof Leap
 * @classdesc
 * The Gesture class represents a recognized movement by the user.
 *
 * The Leap watches the activity within its field of view for certain movement
 * patterns typical of a user gesture or command. For example, a movement from side to
 * side with the hand can indicate a swipe gesture, while a finger poking forward
 * can indicate a screen tap gesture.
 *
 * When the Leap recognizes a gesture, it assigns an ID and adds a
 * Gesture object to the frame gesture list. For continuous gestures, which
 * occur over many frames, the Leap updates the gesture by adding
 * a Gesture object having the same ID and updated properties in each
 * subsequent frame.
 *
 * **Important:** Recognition for each type of gesture must be enabled;
 * otherwise **no gestures are recognized or reported**.
 *
 * Subclasses of Gesture define the properties for the specific movement patterns
 * recognized by the Leap.
 *
 * The Gesture subclasses for include:
 *
 * * CircleGesture -- A circular movement by a finger.
 * * SwipeGesture -- A straight line movement by the hand with fingers extended.
 * * ScreenTapGesture -- A forward tapping movement by a finger.
 * * KeyTapGesture -- A downward tapping movement by a finger.
 *
 * Circle and swipe gestures are continuous and these objects can have a
 * state of start, update, and stop.
 *
 * The screen tap gesture is a discrete gesture. The Leap only creates a single
 * ScreenTapGesture object appears for each tap and it always has a stop state.
 *
 * Get valid Gesture instances from a Frame object. You can get a list of gestures
 * from the Frame gestures array. You can also use the Frame gesture() method
 * to find a gesture in the current frame using an ID value obtained in a
 * previous frame.
 *
 * Gesture objects can be invalid. For example, when you get a gesture by ID
 * using Frame.gesture(), and there is no gesture with that ID in the current
 * frame, then gesture() returns an Invalid Gesture object (rather than a null
 * value). Always check object validity in situations where a gesture might be
 * invalid.
