 * The Hand class reports the physical characteristics of a detected hand.
 *
 * Hand tracking data includes a palm position and velocity; vectors for
 * the palm normal and direction to the fingers; properties of a sphere fit
 * to the hand; and lists of the attached fingers and tools.
 *
 * Note that Hand objects can be invalid, which means that they do not contain
 * valid tracking data and do not correspond to a physical entity. Invalid Hand
 * objects can be the result of asking for a Hand object using an ID from an
 * earlier frame when no Hand objects with that ID exist in the current frame.
 * A Hand object created from the Hand constructor is also invalid.
 * Test for validity with the {@link Leap.Hand#valid} property.
