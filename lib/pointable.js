 *
 * Both fingers and tools are classified as Pointable objects. Use the
 * Pointable.tool property to determine whether a Pointable object represents a
 * tool or finger. The Leap classifies a detected entity as a tool when it is
 * thinner, straighter, and longer than a typical finger.
 *
 * Note that Pointable objects can be invalid, which means that they do not
 * contain valid tracking data and do not correspond to a physical entity.
 * Invalid Pointable objects can be the result of asking for a Pointable object
 * using an ID from an earlier frame when no Pointable objects with that ID
 * exist in the current frame. A Pointable object created from the Pointable
 * constructor is also invalid. Test for validity with the Pointable.valid
 * property.
