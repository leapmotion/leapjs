/**
 * The Leap.loop() function passes a frame of Leap data to your
 * callback function and then calls window.requestAnimationFrame() after
 * executing your callback function.
 *
 * Leap.loop() sets up the Leap controller and WebSocket connection for you.
 * You do not need to create your own controller when using this method.
 *
 * Your callback function is called on an interval determined by the client
 * browser. Typically, this is on an interval of 60 frames/second. The most
 * recent frame of Leap data is passed to your callback function. If the Leap
 * is producing frames at a slower rate than the browser frame rate, the same
 * frame of Leap data can be passed to your function in successive animation
 * updates.
 *
 * As an alternative, you can create your own Controller object and use a
 * {@link Controller#onFrame onFrame} callback to process the data at
 * the frame rate of the Leap device. See {@link Controller} for an
 * example.
 *
 * @method Leap.loop
 * @param {function} callback A function called when the browser is ready to
 * draw to the screen. The most recent {@link Frame} object is passed to
 * your callback function.
 * @example
 *    Leap.loop( function( frame ) {
 *        // ... your code here
 *    })
